# How to play

when you load the game, you will be asked about a toss which starts with you choosing odd or even<br>
then the computer will choose the opposite of what you chose.<br>
**Example-**: you choose odd. now the computer will chose even<br>
then you both chose a number between 1 to 6, then draw it<br>
if the player's and computer's number sum up to be odd or even<br>
whoever chose odd or even will win <br> and now have the ability to chose batting or balling
batting is where you make the score<br>
balling is where you take the batter out by having both of draws to be the same<br>
then you switch sides and do the same until the other player beats the target score and they win
