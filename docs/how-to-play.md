**Example-**: you choose odd. now the computer will chose even<br>
then you both chose a number between 1 to 6, then draw it<br>
if the player's and computer's number sum up to be odd or even<br><br>
whoever chose odd or even will win <br>

<br> and now have the ability to chose batting or balling
batting is where you make the score<br>
balling is where you take the batter out by having both of draws to be the same<br>
then you switch sides and do the same until the other player beats the target score and they win
